# Paroxetine-Model
PBPK model of paroxetine including CYP2D6 DGIs.

# Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of paroxetine. The model was developed using a broad range of published clinical studies including various CYP2D6 DGIs.

For further details, quantitative model evaluation and extensive documentation please refer to [[1]](https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics14081734).

# Version information
